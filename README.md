# Body Colexifications

This repository contains data and analyses used for a study of body colexifications, for example, HAND-ARM, FINGER-TOE, across various languages. The colexifications were automatically computed for more than 1000 language varieties based on the ClicsCore subset of Lexibank ([List et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01432-0)). The concepts included in the study were taken from a concept list by Tjuka ([2020](https://calc.hypotheses.org/2512)). A subset of 49 body concepts was used to create a network of colexifications.
